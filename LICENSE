                              Preamble

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing
other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify
any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
License, with or without indicating the source.

			    Definitions

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

                             Permissions

  1. Private use.

  You can copy the Program, modify the Program, run the Program on your
server or run modified version etc for private use.

  2. Commercial use.

  This "Commercial use" is indirect.  You can use the Program or modified
version on your server and make a profit from your server. Because the way
you configure the Program and your server is unique, and I am glad for your
support to me.

  3. Modification.

  You can modify it for Private use or Commercial use.  But distributing or
reselling the modified version is not allowed without the author's permission.

  4. Free Distribution.

  Free distribution of the Program is allowed, but you remain obligated
to ensure that it has not been modified.

applicable law.  Except when otherwise stated in writing the Copyright
holders and/or other parties provide the Program "as is" without
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchant ability and fitness for
a particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance
of the Program is with you.  Should the Program prove defective, you
assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

  3. Liability.

  In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
will any Copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and/or conveys
the Program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including
any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of
the use or inability to use the Program (including but not limited to loss
of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or
